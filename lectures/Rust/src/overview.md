# Overview

Rust is a strongly and statically typed systems programming language designed
for performance and safety.

What distinguishes Rust is its innovative combination of high-level abstractions
with low-level control over system resources. Its most distinctive feature is
its ability to guarantee memory safety without a garbage collector, achieved
through its advanced type system.

Rust design principles emphasize zero-cost abstractions that allow for writing
high-level, expressive, and safe code without sacrificing performance.
